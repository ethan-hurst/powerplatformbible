Referencing [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customerengagement/on-premises/developer/download-tools-nuget?view=op-9-1) article from Microsoft I normally find it easiest to simply use powershell to download the SDK. 

How I normally proceed is, I open powershell, and navigate to `c:/users/YourUsername` and simply paste in the script included in the above link. 

This will create a folder by the name of 'tools'. Contained within are the plugin registration tool and some other goodies. Personally I pin this to my quick access bar for easier use.

Voila! You're done.
