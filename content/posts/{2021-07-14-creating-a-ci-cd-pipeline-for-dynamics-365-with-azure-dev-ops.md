So you want a pipeline eh? 

Alright, I'll walk you through my standard fitout for a Dynamics Pipeline. 

What you're going to need before we start permissions wise:

1. Access to manage your Tenants Azure Active Directory
2. System Admin in your target Dataverse Environment
3. The ability to create a Project in Azure Dev Ops or access to an already created project
4. Some experience with Git will be very useful
