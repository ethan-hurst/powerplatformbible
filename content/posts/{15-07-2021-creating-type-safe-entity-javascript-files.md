## Intro

First up, a tip of the hat is required; this post wouldn't be possible without Scott Durow's massive knowledge! If you don't follow him on GitHub or LinkedIn, I cannot highly recommend that you do, as we're going to be leveraging what he has put together here. At the bottom of this post I will leave some references to his work. 

You might be saying to yourself? Why would I even care? I said it myself when I was starting out. Let me go over just a few of the benefits to type safe programming.

1. You know exactly what type you're working with
2. You are **going** to save time developing, by avoiding type errors

With all that said, lets dig into how!
