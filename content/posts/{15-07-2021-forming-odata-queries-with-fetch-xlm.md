This one is a very quick tip.

Sometimes its just in the too hard basket to form the OData Query for Power Automate Flows

Thankfully, we have far smarter people in the Power Platform/ Dataverse community who have written this handy tool for the XRM Toolbox

Using this tool, we can form our query in Dynamics 365 Advanced find, and export that fetch XML especially helpful if you're forming a complex query.

Now all we need to do is open that file in our Fetch XML Builder Plugin for the Xrm Toolbox and hit this navigation link
